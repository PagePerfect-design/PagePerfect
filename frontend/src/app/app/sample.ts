export const SAMPLE_MD = `# Maritime Trade in the 17th Century

Dr. Alistair Finch argues that Bristol's maritime networks reshaped Atlantic economies. As noted by [@Finch2023], merchants coordinated flows of capital, commodities, and information across ports.

## Background
The longue durée perspective frames trade as a system of structures rather than isolated events.  This view emphasizes how shipping routes, credit instruments, and port institutions evolved together.

## Chapter 1 — Bristol and the Atlantic
Bristol's ship registries reveal dense ties to Ireland, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Americas. Surviving manifests show iterative risk-sharing arrangements among syndicates.

### Method
This manuscript uses primary customs ledgers and port books, cross-checked with secondary sources. Tables and figures are omitted in this short sample.

## Conclusion
Early-modern trade networks laid foundations for global capitalism [@Braudel1982].
