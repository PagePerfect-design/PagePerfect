## 8) Recommended Reading
For a comprehensive understanding of grid systems in graphic design, we recommend Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockmann's "Grid Systems in Graphic Design." This seminal work inspired PagePerfect's systematic approach to typography and layout:

ðŸ“š [Grid Systems in Graphic Design - Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockmann](https://ia902309.us.archive.org/4/items/GridSystemsInGraphicDesignJosefMullerBrockmann/Grid%20systems%20in%20graphic%20design%20-%20Josef%20Muller-Brockmann.pdf)

PagePerfect implements MÃ¼ller-Brockmann's principles of systematic organization, baseline grids, and proportional typography for professional-quality PDF generation.
