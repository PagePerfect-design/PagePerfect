# docs-map.md — Every user-facing doc

The map `docs-coherence-audit` reads. One row per doc. New docs appended on creation; obsolete docs removed via ADR (never silently).

## Schema

```
| Path | Surface | Owner | Depends on | Last reviewed | Notes |
```

- **Path**: file path or URL.
- **Surface**: marketing / product / api / legal / contributor / internal.
- **Owner**: council # (the role accountable for accuracy).
- **Depends on**: code paths or specs whose change requires re-reviewing this doc.
- **Last reviewed**: YYYY-MM-DD when the doc was last verified against current product behaviour.
- **Notes**: known stale sections, planned rewrites, special handling.

## Drift signals (what to watch for)

- **Code change without doc review**: PR touches a path in "Depends on" but no doc in this map updated → flag.
- **Last-reviewed > 90 days for marketing / product / api docs** → flag.
- **Last-reviewed > 365 days for legal docs** → escalate to legal council.
- **Internal docs unrelated to current pilots** → mark for archival.
- **Two docs that contradict** → P0; route to `writer` + the affected dept lead.

## Audit cadence

- Quarterly full sweep by `docs-coherence-audit`.
- Ad-hoc on operator request (e.g., before a major release).
- Per-doc spot-check whenever the "Depends on" code path lands a non-trivial change.

## Maintenance

- New doc: append a row on the same commit that creates the doc.
- Removed doc: ADR + remove row in the same commit.
- Owner change: update the row + note in commit message.
